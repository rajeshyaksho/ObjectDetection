# Real-Time Object Detection

Overview:
Real-Time Object Detection is a project that is based on artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision techniques to detect and classify objects in real-time using a webcam feed. The project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, which is capable of detecting a wide range of objects with high accuracy and speed.
